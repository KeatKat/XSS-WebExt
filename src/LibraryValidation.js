        <p>
          Library Validation involves the assessment and verification of JavaScript
          libraries and frameworks used in web applications. It ensures that the chosen
          libraries are up-to-date, free of known vulnerabilities, and adhere to best
          practices for secure coding.
        </p>
        <p>
          Keeping libraries validated is crucial for maintaining the security and
          stability of web applications. Developers should regularly check for updates,
          review release notes for security patches, and consider using tools that
          automate the validation process to stay ahead of potential security risks.
